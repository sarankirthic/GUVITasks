# Question 1

1. Design a Java program that uses OOP principles to model the Book. Create two classes: Book and Library. 
The Book class should have attributes such as bookID, title, author, and isAvailable.
The library class should include an array to store book objects.

2. Provide methods to add books, remove books, search books(using id) and display books.
Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of these classes and 
methods by allowing the user to interact with the library system
