# Task 2

The solution to this weeks tasks are split into separate files.

## Questions
Write a Java program for the following questions (OOPs)

### Question 1
Create a class `Person` with properties (`name` and `age`) with the following features:
- a. Default age of person should be 18.
- b. A person object can be initialized with name and age.
- c. Method to display name and age of the person.

### Question 2
Create class `Product` (`pid`, `price`, `quantity`) with a parameterized constructor.
Create a main function in a different class (say `ProductMain`) and perform the following tasks:
- a. Accept five product information from user and store in an array.
- b. Find `pid` of the product with the highest price.
- c. Create a method (with an array of product objects as an argument) in the `ProductMain` class to calculate and return the total amount spent on all products.
  > Amount spent on a single product = price of product * quantity of product

### Question 3
Create class `Account` with data member `balance`.
Create two constructors (no-argument and with argument) and perform the following tasks:
- a. Method to deposit the amount to the account.
- b. Method to withdraw the amount from the account.
- c. Method to display the balance.

### Question 4
Define a base class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`.
Create a subclass `Employee` that inherits from `Person` and adds attributes like `employeeID` and `salary`.  
Use the `super` keyword to initialize the `Person` attributes in the `Employee` constructor.
